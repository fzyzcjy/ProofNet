# ProofNet
A benchmark for undergraduate-level formal mathematics. We pose problems that require knowledge of introductory
- linear algbera, 
- abstract algebra, 
- real analysis, 
- complex analysis, 
- topology 

to solve. 

We categorize each problem as basic, intermediate, or advanced. Basic problems mostly demand reasoning through the definitions. Intermediate problems require one or two ingenious steps, and advanced problems are approximately at the level of a competition like the Putnam exam. 
## Naming Conventions
- Problems coming from books should be named `{authors}_{chapter}_{problem_number}` or `{authors}_{chapter}_{section}_{problem_number}`, e.g `rudin_3_8` or `dummitfoote_3_2_1`. 
- Problems coming from competitions should be named `{competition}_{year}_{problem_number}`, e.g `imo_1990_6` or `putnam_2021_b4`. 
- Problems coming from other Github repositires should be named `{repository_name}_{some reasonable scheme for identifying the problem}` 
- Original problems should be given a short descriptive name, roughly in line with mathlib conventions. 

All non-original problems should have an attribution in their docstring.
